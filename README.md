## Collection of (python) solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Information:
  Projects can be found with a folder for each given day, with a `part1.py` and `part2.py` for that day's respective challenges, along with an input.txt for each day, which were the inputs for that day's challenges.

## Note:
  I have been busy and have did not complete all the challenges within the month they were given, but I will return to this some time in the future.
